/**
 * The <code>ISVNEditor</code> interface provides methods that should be used
 * to follow  repository server's instructions on how the client's command (update,
 * switch, checkout, status, diff, commit) should be handled depending on possible 
 * changes that have been applied to the client's working copy and/or its origin in 
 * the repository . 
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>In update-like operations:</b>
 * <p>
 * When having the working copy revisions described to the server (by making reports
 * with the help of <code>ISVNReporter</code> from within 
 * {@link ISVNReporterBaton#report(ISVNReporter) ISVNReporterBaton.report()}) the
 * server now knows of the working copy state (revisions of all its entries) and 
 * starts performing the client's requested operation. This means the server sends
 * commands to the client's Repository Access Layer which parses them and translates
 * to appropriate calls of <code>ISVNEditor</code>'s methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>In a commit:</b>
 * <p>
 * A commit editor is used to describe a repository server all changes done against
 * the BASE-revision of the working copy.
