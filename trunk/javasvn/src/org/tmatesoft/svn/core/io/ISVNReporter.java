/**
 * This is a basic interface for implementors to describe a working copy state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ISVNReporter</code> implementations are handled by 
 * <code>ISVNReporterBaton</code> to describe a subset
 * (or possibly all) of the working copy (WC) to the Repository Access Layer for the
 * purposes of an update, switch, status, or diff operation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Paths for report calls are relative to the target of the operation (that is the 
 * directory where the command was run). Report calls must be made in depth-first 
 * order: parents before children, all children of a parent before any
 * siblings of the parent.  The first report call must be a 
 * {@link #setPath(String, String, long, boolean) setPath()} with a path argument of
 * "" and a valid revision.  (If the target of the operation is locally deleted or 
 * missing, use the WC root's revision.)  If the target of the operation is 
 * deleted or switched relative to the WC root, follow up the initial 
 * {@link #setPath(String, String, long, boolean) setPath()} call with a
 * {@link #linkPath(SVNURL, String, String, long, boolean) linkPath()}
 * or {@link #deletePath(String) deletePath()} call with a path argument of "" to
 * indicate that.  In no other case may there be two report
 * descriptions for the same path.  If the target of the operation is
 * a locally added file or directory (which previously did not exist),
 * it may be reported as having revision 0 or as having the parent
 * directory's revision.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> the WC root is the root directory of the entire working copy that was
 * checked out from the repository.
