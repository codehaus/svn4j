/*
 * This example program illustrates how you can export a clean directory tree 
 * from a repository using the SVNRepository.update method. Actually, a checkout 
 * (compatible with the native Subversion command line client) works in a similar 
 * way but additionally administrative directories are created (one .svn directory
 * per each exported directory).
 * 
 * Basic aspects of this example:
 * 
 * 0)first of all the library is initialized (setupLibrary() method) - it must be
 * done prior to using the library;
 * 
 * 1)an SVNRepository is created to the location (represented by a URL string) that 
 * will be the root of the repository tree to be exported;
 * 
 * 2)user's authentication is usually non-necessary for reading operations however the
 * repository may have a restriction to accept requests of only authenticated users;
 * the example shows how to provide user's authentication info;
 * 
 * 3)INTRO: you have to implement ISVNReporterBaton and ISVNEditor to affect the 
 * behaviour of the SVNRepository.update method (for ISVNReporterBaton an 
 * implementation depends on whether you want to update your copy of a repository 
 * node that may have been changed since you last updated it (or checked out) or you
 * have no copy yet but want to check it out; for ISVNEditor an implementation 
 * depends on how exactly you would like either to save the exported copy - if you 
 * perform a checkout, - or bring  the copy up to date if you already have the copy). 
 * The aim of ISVNReporterBaton is to report to the repository server about the state 
 * of the user's working files and directories when they are updated as well as report
 * that there are no directories and files yet, they are to be exported - in the case 
 * of a checkout. Then having got this description information the server sends
 * commands which are translated into calls to your ISVNEditor implementation methods 
 * where you define how exactly files and directories to be updated/exported.
 * 
 * Calling SVNRepository.update you also provide the number of the revision you wish to
 * be updated to. As for an export/checkout - this will be the revision of the 
 * exported/checked out repository tree copy.
 * 
 * For more details see descriptions of UpdateReporterBaton, UpdateEditor in this 
 * program code.
 * 
 * If the program succeeds you'll see something like this:
 * 
 * Exported revision: 82

     * definite revision (that is passed to SVNRepository.update) 
     * ISVNReporterBaton.report should describe to the server revisions of all the 
     * copies if their revisions differ from the update target revision. 
     * Suppose you have got the following tree you have somewhen checked out from a
     * repository:
     *  
     *  /(4)
     *  /dirA(5)/
     *   	    /dirB(6)/

     *          /file3.txt(7)
     *           
     * Numbers in brackets correspond to revisions. Well, you see that the root 
     * directory has the revision number=4, dirA - 5, dirB - 6 and so on. When you
     * call SVNRepository.update to bring the root directory up to date say to revision
     * 8 you should describe the revisions of all the entries top-down for each 
     * directory (starting with the root):
     *	
     *	public void report(ISVNReporter reporter) throws SVNException {
     *		//for the root directory
     *		reporter.setPath("", null, 4, false);
     *		
     *		//for "/dirA"
     *		reporter.setPath("/dirA", null, 5, false);
     *		
     *		//for "/dirA/dirB"
     *		reporter.setPath("/dirA/dirB", null, 6, false);
     *		
     *		//for "/dirA/dirB/file1.txt"
     *		reporter.setPath("/dirA/dirB/file1.txt", null, 6, false);
     *		
     *		//for "/dirA/dirC"
     *		reporter.setPath("/dirA/dirC", null, 4, false);
     *		
     *		....//and so on for all entries which revisions differ from 8
     *		
     *		//always called at the end of the report - when the state of the 
     *		//entire tree is described.
     *		reporter.finishReport();
     *	}
     *
     * Several significant moments:
     * - if some file was locked then you should provide the lock-token for
     *   that entry as the 2nd parameter of ISVNReporter.setPath(). For example:
     *
     *		/(4)
     *	    /file.txt(7, locked)
     *	 
     *   file.txt is at the 7th revision and was locked.
     *
     *		reporter.setPath("/file.txt", lockToken, 7, false);
     *
     *   Even though the revision of the locked file is the same as the target update
     *   revision ISVNReporter.setPath is called for such file anyway.  
     *  
     * - The last parameter of ISVNReporter.setPath - boolean flag startEmpty - must be
     *   true for a checkout. Also it's set to true for those directories that were not 
     *   updated at a previous time due to errors (if such situation had a place). So,
     * 	 startEmpty=true means the directory is still empty.
     * 	 In other cases it must be false.
     * 
     * - If a user's local working copy is updated against a URL different from that
     * 	 it was checked out from, then instead of calling reporter.setPath you should
     * 	 call:
     *      
     * 		reporter.linkPath(newRepositoryLocation, path, lockToken, revision, false);   
     * 	 
     * 	 newRepositoryLocation is a URL string which is the new parent root
     * 	 (meaning path is relative to this root since this moment). That's the only
     * 	 difference between just an update and a switch.
     * 
     * - If an entry was scheduled for deletion or if it's a missing directory (that was
     * 	 accidentally deleted) then you should call:
     * 		
     * 		//report that the path was deleted
     * 		reporter.deletePath(path);
     * 
     * - At the end of the report call ISVNReporter.finishReport() that denotes the end
     * 	 of the report.  
     * - One more important moment: if during a report an exception occured - the report
     * 	 failed - call ISVNReporter.abortReport() that properly finishes the report in a
     * 	 case of a fault.
     * 
     * Well, that's about how it works in common words. As for this example program 
     * there's no need in a full report since we're only going to export entry(ies) from 
     * a repository. So, ExportReporterBaton is a simple implementation of 
     * ISVNReporterBaton that describes that intention.

     * That is how an update runs in common words. The described scheme is analogous for

     * and file that must be updated.
     *

     * ISVNEditor.openFile are not called, instead ISVNEditor.addDir, ISVNEditor.addFile
     * are called for each directory and file to be checked out. This is a principal 
     * model of how ISVNEditor methods are invoked during a checkout(suppose we are 
     * checking out some node tree from a repository what will lead us to the previous
     * illustrartion when the local copy already exists):
     * 
     * 		//sets the target revision of the copy being checked out.
     * 		editor.targetRevision(revision)
     * 		
     * 		//ISVNEditor.openRoot is not called;
     * 		//setting root directory properties.
     * 		editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName, propertyValue);
     * 		
     * 		//adds "/dirA". copyDirFromPath & copyFromRevision - are irrelevant in
     * 		//an update editor.
     * 		//If you want to have a compatibility with the native Subversion command
     * 		//line client in the case of a checkout (not simply an export) an 
     * 		//implementation of this method should create an administrative area 
     * 		//(.svn directory) for the directory being added ("/dirA"). 
     * 		editor.addDir("/dirA", copyDirFromPath, CopyFromRevision);
     *
     * 		//setting the directory properties - they may be stored in the 
     * 		//previously created .svn directory (SVN command line client 
     * 		//compatibility).
     *  	//Also all further calls like editor.addFile(...)/editor.addDir(...)
     * 		//are relative to the added directory.
