 * This class is an implementation of ISVNEventHandler intended to reflect the

 * committing a working copy with invoking SVNCommitClient.doCommit(..)) as of a 
 * number of actions it performs, - for example, for committing, a current action 
 * can be deleting a directory or adding a file. And there can be several of them. 
 * So, the SVN*Client* notifies an ISVNEventHandler provided by an implementor of 
 * each action it's running. Information on each action is incapsulated by SVNEvent
 * and is reported by ISVNEventHandler.svnEvent(SVNEvent event, double progress).
