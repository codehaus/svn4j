/*
 * This is a complex example program that demonstrates how you can manage local
 * working copies as well as URLs (that is items located in the repository) by means 
 * of the API provided in the org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc package. The package itself 
 * represents a high-level API consisting of classes and interfaces which allow to 
 * perform operations compatible with ones of the native Subversion command line 
 * client. These version control operations are logically grouped in a set of classes
 * which names meet 'SVN*Client' pattern. For example, the package has SVNUpdateClient 
 * which is responsible for update-related operations (update, switch, check out).  
 * Most of the  methods of these 'client' classes are named like 'doSomething(...)' where 
 * 'Something' corresponds to the name of a Subversion command line client's operation. So, 
 * for users familiar with the Subversion command line client it won't take much effort
 * and time to match a 'do*' method and an appropriate Subversion client's operation (or 
 * command, in other words).
 * 
 * Surely, it may seem not quite handy to deal with a number of classes that all need to be 
 * instantiated, initialized, maybe something else... For example, if a developer is going 
 * to use all (or several) of the SVN*Client classes and most of them will access the repository 
 * (in that way when authentication is demanded), it becomes annoying to provide authentication 
 * info to every one of them. So, that is why the package has got the class called 
 * SVNClientManager whose get*Client() methods provide all necessary SVN*Client objects to a 
 * caller. 
 * 
 * A developer once creates an instance of SVNClientManager providing (if needed) his 
 * authentication info/options (which functions (i.e. destination) are similar to SVN 
 * run-time configuration settings) into an appropriate SVNClientManager.newInstance(..) 
 * method. Further all SVN*Client objects provided by the instance of SVNClientManager will 
 * use these authentication info/options.   
 *  
 * The program illustrates a number of main operations usually carried out upon 
 * working copies and URLs. A brief description of what the program does:
 * 
 * 0)first of all initializes the JavaSVN library (it must be done prior to using
 * the library);
 * 
 * 1)if the program was run with some in parameters it fetches them out of the args 
 * parameter;
 * 
 * 2)next a user's authentication manager is created - almost all methods require
 * an ISVNOptions (a subinterface of ISVNAuthenticationManager) to authenticate 
 * the user when it becomes necessary during an access to a repository server;
 * 
 * 3)the first operation - making an empty directory in a repository; String url is 
 * to be a directory that will be created (it should consist of the URL of an existing
 * repository and the name of the directory itself that will be created just under
 * the repository directory - that is like 'svn mkdir URL' which creates a new 
 * directory given all the intermediate directories created); this operation is based
 * upon an URL - so, it's immediately committed to the repository;
 * 
 * 4)the next operation  - creating a new local directory (importDir) and a new file 
 * (importFile) in it and then importing the directory into the repository. 
 * 
 * 5)the next operation - checking out the directory created in the previous 
 * step to a local directory defined by myWorkspacePath; 
 * 
 * 6)the next operation - recursively getting and displaying info for each item  at 
 * the working revision in the working copy that was checked out in the previous 
 * step;
 * 
 * 7)the next operation - creating a new directory (newDir) with a file (newFile) in
 * the working copy and then recursively scheduling (if any subdirictories existed 
 * they would be also added) the created directory for addition;
 * 
 * 8)the next operation - recursively getting and displaying the working copy status
 * not including unchanged (normal) paths; the result must include those paths which
 * were scheduled for addition in the previous step; 
 * 
 * 9)the next operation - recursively updating the working copy; if any local items
 * are out of date they will be updated to the latest revision;
 * 
 * 10)the next operation - committing local changes to the repository; this operation
 * will add the directory with the file that were scheduled for addition to the 
 * repository;
 * 
 * 11)the next operation - locking the file added in the previous step (for example, 
 * if you temporarily need to keep a file locked to prevent someone's else 
 * modifications);
 * 
 * 12)the next operation - showing status once again (for example, to see that the 
 * file was locked);
 * 
 * 13)the next operation - copying with history one URL (url) to another one (copyURL)
 * within the same repository;
 * 
 * 14)the next operation - switching the working copy to a different URL - to copyURL
 * where url was copied to in the previous step;
 * 
 * 15)the next operation - recursively getting and displaying info on the root 
 * directory of the working copy to demonstrate that the working copy is now really
 * switched against copyURL;
 * 
 * 16)the next operation - scheduling the directory (newDir) for deletion;
 * 
 * 17)the next operation - showing status once again (for example, to see that the 
 * directory with all its entries were scheduled for deletion);
 * 
 * 18)the next operation - committing local changes to the repository; this operation
 * will delete the directory (newDir) with the file (newFile) that were scheduled for
 * deletion from the repository;
 * 
 * This example can be run for a locally installed Subversion repository via the
 * svn:// protocol. This is how you can do it:
 * 
 * 1)after you install the Subversion (available for download at 
 * http://subversion.tigris.org/) you should create a new repository in a
 * directory, like this (in a command line under Windows OS):
 * 
 * >svnadmin create X:\path\to\rep
 * 
 * 2)after the repository is created you can add a new account: open
 * X:\path\to\rep\, then move into \conf and open the file - passwd. In the file you'll
 * see the section [users]. Uncomment it and add a new account below the section
 * name, like:
 * 
 * [users] 
 * userName = userPassword.
 * 
 * In the program you may further use this account as user's credentials.
 * 
 * 3)the next step is to launch the custom Subversion server - svnserve - in a
 * background mode for the just created repository:
 * 
 * >svnserve -d -r X:\path\to
 * 
 * That's all. The repository is now available via svn://localhost/rep.
 * As it has been already mentioned url parameter should not be an existing path 
 * within the directory where you have created your repository (svn://localhost/rep)
 * but one level below (for example, svn://localhost/rep/MyRepos which is used by
 * default in the program) since the program starts with creating a new directory in
 * a repository. If this directory already exists the program will certainly fail.
 * 
 * While the program is running you'll see something like this:

     * b) dstURL doesn't exist yet - then doCopy(..) will create a directory and
     * recursively copy entries from srcURL into dstURL (for example, consider 
     * srcURL = svn://localhost/rep/MyRepos, dstURL = svn://localhost/rep/MyReposCopy, 
     * in this case if doCopy(..) succeeds MyRepos entries will be in MyReposCopy, like:
     * svn://localhost/rep/MyRepos/Dir1 -> svn://localhost/rep/MyReposCopy/Dir1...);

     * it exists, of course); if dstURL does not exist yet dstPegRevision is set to 
     * null;
     * 
     * move - if false (as in this example) then srcURL is only copied to dstURL what
     * corresponds to 'svn copy srcURL dstURL -m "some comment"'; but if it's true then
     * srcURL will be copied and deleted - 'svn move srcURL dstURL -m "some comment"' 
     * per se; 
     *

     * committed to a repository.
