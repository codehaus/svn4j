/*
 * This is an example of how to commit several types of changes to a repository:
 * a new directory with a file, modification to a file, copying a directory into
 * a branch, deletion of the directory and its entries.
 * 
 * Main aspects of performing a commit with the help of ISVNEditor:
 * 0)initialize the library (this is done in setupLibrary() method);
 * 
 * 1)create an SVNRepository to the location (represented by a URL string) that will 
 * be the root for committing - that is all paths that are being committed will be 
 * below that root;
 * 
 * 2)provide user's authentication (committing generally requires authentication);
 * 
 * 3)"ask" your SVNRepository for a commit editor (use an
 * SVNRepository.getCommitEditor method);
 * 
 * 4)perform a sequence of descriptions of changes to the repository server (for
 * example, here you "say" to the server that you have added such-and-such a new
 * directory at such-and-such a path as well as a new file). These descriptions
 * are calls to ISVNEditor's methods. First of all ISVNEditor.openRoot() is
 * called as a start point for further processing.
 * 
 * 5)At last you close the editor with the ISVNEditor.closeEdit method that
 * fixes your modificaions in the repository and provides new commit
 * information.
 * 
 * For each commit a new ISVNEditor is required - that is after having been
 * closed the editor can no longer be used!
 * 
 * This example can be run for a locally installed Subversion repository via the
 * svn:// protocol. This is how you can do it:
 * 
 * 1)after you install the Subversion (available for download at 
 * http://subversion.tigris.org/) you should create a new repository in a
 * directory, like this (in a command line under Windows OS):
 * 
 * >svnadmin create X:\path\to\rep
 * 
 * 2)after the repository is created you can add a new account: open
 * X:\path\to\rep\, then move to \conf and open the file - passwd. In the file you'll
 * see the section [users]. Uncomment it and add a new account below the section
 * name, like:
 * 
 * [users] 
 * userName = userPassword.
 * 
 * In the program you may further use this account as user's credentials.
 * 
 * 3)the next step is to launch the custom Subversion server - svnserve - in a
 * background mode for the just created repository:
 * 
 * >svnserve -d -r X:\path\to
 * 
 * That's all. The repository is now available via svn://localhost/rep.
 * 
 * 
 * As an example here's one of the program layouts:
 * 
 * Repository latest revision (before committing): 48
 * 
 * The directory was added. 
 * The last author:userName 
 * Date:Thu Jun 09 13:22:40 NOVST 2005 
 * Committed to revision 49
 * 
 * The file was changed. 
 * The last author:userName 
 * Date:Thu Jun 09 13:22:40 NOVST 2005 
 * Committed to revision 50
 * 
 * The directory was copied to a branch. 
 * The last author:userName 
 * Date:Thu Jun 09 13:22:40 NOVST 2005 
 * Committed to revision 51
 * 
 * The directory was deleted. 
 * The last author:userName 
 * Date:Thu Jun 09 13:22:40 NOVST 2005 
 * Committed to revision 52
