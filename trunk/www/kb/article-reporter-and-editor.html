<p>
The following article shortly describes the mechanism of an update-related operation (update, check out, switch, etc.) in terms
of the <b>JavaSVN</b> low-level API (<b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io</b> package). The article is rather dedicated to using 
<code>ISVNReporter/ISVNEditor</code> interfaces which are the key 'figures' in those operations.    
</p>

<!--<a name="low-level-api"></a><h3>1. How an update-related operation is performed using low-level API (org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io package)</h3>-->
<h4>How to use ISVNReporter</h4>
<p>
When <code>SVNRepository.update(..)</code> is called <code>ISVNReporterBaton.report(..)</code> 
is invoked to make reports (with the help of <code>ISVNReporter</code>) of the working files/directories
state. For example, if the scope is to update existing local items to some 
definite revision (that is passed to <code>SVNRepository.update(..)</code>) 
<code>ISVNReporterBaton.report(..)</code> should describe to the server revisions of all the 
items (files, directories) if their revisions differ from the update target revision. 
Suppose you have got the following tree you have somewhen checked out from a
repository:
</p>
<pre>
  /(4)
  /dirA(5)/
          /dirB(6)/
                  /file1.txt(6)
          /dirC(4)/
                  /file2.txt(5)
          /file3.txt(7)
</pre>
           
<p>
Numbers in brackets correspond to revisions. Well, you see that the root 
directory has the revision number = 4, dirA - 5, dirB - 6 and so on. When you
call <code>SVNRepository.update(..)</code> to bring the root directory up to date say to revision
8 you should describe the revisions of all the entries top-down for each 
directory (starting with the root):
</p>
<pre class="javaCode">
<span class="javaKeyword">import</span> org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.<code>ISVNReporterBaton</code>;
<span class="javaKeyword">import</span> org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.<code>ISVNReporter</code>;

<span class="javaKeyword">public class</span> MyReporterBaton <span class="javaKeyword">implements</span> <code>ISVNReporterBaton</code> {
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="javaKeyword">public void</span> report(<code>ISVNReporter</code> reporter) <span class="javaKeyword">throws</span> <code>SVNException</code> {

	<span class="javaCommentSingle">//for the root directory</span>
	reporter.setPath(<span class="javaString">""</span>, <span class="javaKeyword">null</span>, 4, <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);
	
	<span class="javaCommentSingle">//for "/dirA"</span>
	reporter.setPath(<span class="javaString">"/dirA"</span>, <span class="javaKeyword">null</span>, 5, <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);
	
	<span class="javaCommentSingle">//for "/dirA/dirB"</span>
	reporter.setPath(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/dirB"</span>, <span class="javaKeyword">null</span>, 6, <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);
		
	<span class="javaCommentSingle">//for "/dirA/dirB/file1.txt"</span>
	reporter.setPath(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/dirB/file1.txt"</span>, <span class="javaKeyword">null</span>, 6, <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);

	<span class="javaCommentSingle">//for "/dirA/dirC"</span>
	reporter.setPath(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/dirC"</span>, <span class="javaKeyword">null</span>, 4, <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);
    
	....<span class="javaCommentSingle">//and so on for all entries which revisions differ from 8</span>

	<span class="javaCommentMulti">/* always called at the end of the report - when the state of the 
	 * entire tree is described.
	 */</span>
	reporter.finishReport();
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
</pre>
<p>
Several significant moments:
<ul>
<li> 
if some file(s) was(were) locked then you should provide the lock-token for
that file(s) as the 2nd parameter of <code>ISVNReporter.setPath(..)</code>. For example:
<pre>
	/(4)
	/file.txt(7, locked)
</pre>
file.txt is at the 7th revision and was locked.
<pre class="javaCode">
	reporter.setPath(<span class="javaString">"/file.txt"</span>, lockToken, 7, <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);
</pre>
Even though the revision of the locked file is the same as the target update
revision <code>ISVNReporter.setPath(..)</code> is called for such file anyway.  
</li>  
<li>
The last parameter of <code>ISVNReporter.setPath(..)</code> - boolean flag startEmpty - must be
<span class="javaKeyword">true</span> for a checkout. Also it's set to <span class="javaKeyword">true</span> for those directories 
that were not successfully updated at a previous time due to errors (if such situation had a place). So, startEmpty = <span class="javaKeyword">true</span> 
means the directory is still empty. In other cases it must be <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>.
</li>
<li> 
If a user's local item (file/directory) is updated against a URL different from that
it was checked out from (being switched in other words), then instead of calling <code>reporter.setPath(..)</code> you should
call:
<pre class="javaCode">
<span class="javaKeyword">import</span> org.tmatesoft.svn.core.<code>SVNURL</code>;
...    
    reporter.linkPath(newRepositoryLocation, path, 
                      lockToken, revision, 
                      <span class="javaKeyword">false</span>);
</pre>
newRepositoryLocation is an <code>SVNURL</code> instance which is the new parent root
(meaning <span style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: 10pt;">path</span> is relative to this root since this moment). 
That's the only difference between just an update and a switch.
</li>
<li> 
If an item was scheduled for deletion or if it's a missing directory (that was
accidentally deleted) then you should call:
<pre class="javaCode">
	<span class="javaCommentSingle">//report that the path was deleted</span>
	reporter.deletePath(path);
</pre>
</li>
 <li>
At the end of the report call <code>ISVNReporter.finishReport()</code> that denotes the end
of the report.  
</li>
<li>  
One more important moment: if during a report an exception occured - the report
failed - call <code>ISVNReporter.abortReport()</code> that properly finishes the report in a
case of a fault.
</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<h4>How to use ISVNEditor</h4>
<p>
When <code>ISVNReporterBaton</code> has finished his work and the server knows everything
of the user's local versioned items (dirs and files) state it sends to the client commands as
well as data (file/dir properties and file delta) to bring client's items up to date.
These commands are translated into calls to <code>ISVNEditor</code> methods.
</p>
<p>
Suppose there's the following local tree which is being updated 
recursively (starting with the directory the update was initiated on and 
moving deep down) to 8th revision:
<pre>
    /(5)
    /dirA(5)/
            /file1.txt(5)
            /file2.txt(5)
</pre>
Assume that only file1.txt is out of date and must be updated. The server sends 
commands to update the file which are translated into series of calls to 
<code>ISVNEditor</code> methods. Here is the scheme of this process (an implementor himself
doesn't make these calls, his aim is only to provide an <code>ISVNEditor</code> 
implementation to <code>SVNRepository.update(..)</code> method; the following is rather an illustration describing how the <b>JavaSVN</b>
library invokes <code>ISVNEditor</code> methods):
<pre class="javaCode">
     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//sets the target revision the copy is being updated to.</span>
     editor.targetRevision(revision);

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* processing starts with the parent directory the update was
      * run for - "/"; now modifications can be applied to the opened 
      * directory.
      */</span>
     editor.openRoot(revision);

     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//changing root directory properties</span>
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName1, propertyValue1);
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName2, propertyValue2);
    
     .....................................
    
     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//opens "/dirA".</span>
     editor.openDir(<span class="javaString">"/dirA"</span>, revision);

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* now modifications can be applied to the opened directory. 
      * For example, changing its properties.
      * Also all further calls like editor.openFile(..), 
      * editor.addFile(..) or editor.openDir(..), editor.addDir(..) 
      * are relative to the currently opened directory.
      */</span>
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName1, propertyValue1);
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName2, propertyValue2);

     .....................................

     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//opens file "file1.txt" to modify it</span>
     editor.openFile(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>, revision);
 		
     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//changing properties of "file1.txt"</span>
     editor.changeFileProperty(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>, propertyName1, propertyValue1);
     editor.changeFileProperty(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>, propertyName2, propertyValue2);
     
     .....................................

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* file contents are out of date - the server sends delta
      * (the difference between the local BASE-revision copy and 
      * the file in the repository).
      * baseChecksum is provided by the server to make certain of 
      * the delta will be applied correctly - the client should 
      * compare it with his own one evaluated upon the contents of 
      * the file at the BASE revision - that is the state of the file 
      * it had just after the previous update (or checkout). If both 
      * checksums match each other - it's ok, the delta can be applied 
      * correctly, if don't - may be the local file is
      * corrupted, that's an error.
      */</span>
     editor.applyTextDelta(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>, baseChecksum);

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* well, if the previous step was ok, the next step is to receive

      */</span>
     OutputStream os = editor.textDeltaChunk(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>, diffWindow);
 
     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* the following is called when all the delta is received.

     editor.textDeltaEnd(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>);
 		
     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* the final point of the file modification: once again the server 
      * sends a checksum to control if the resultant file ("file1.txt") 
      * was modified correctly; the client repeats the operation of

      */</span> 
     editor.closeFile(<span class="javaString">"/dirA/file1.txt"</span>, textChecksum);

     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//closes the directory  - "/dirA"</span>
     editor.closeDir();
 
     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//closes the root directory - "/"</span>
     editor.closeDir();

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* editing ends with a call to ISVNEditor.closeEdit() which returns
      * the commit information (SVNCommitInfo) - what revision the copy is

      */</span>   
     SVNCommitInfo commitInfo = editor.closeEdit();
 </pre>
</p>
<p>
That is how an update runs in common words. The described scheme is analogous for
the case when more than one file is out of date (what is more actual in reality), 
the local copy tree is processed (by an <code>ISVNEditor</code>) top-down for each directory 
and file that must be updated.
</p>
<p> 
Well, the case of a checkout is a little bit different. <code>ISVNEditor.openDir(..)</code> and 
<code>ISVNEditor.openFile(..)</code> are not called, instead <code>ISVNEditor.addDir(..)</code>, <code>ISVNEditor.addFile(..)</code>
are called for each directory and file to be checked out. This is a principal 
model of how <code>ISVNEditor</code> methods are invoked during a checkout (suppose we are 
checking out some node tree from a repository what will lead us to the previous
illustrartion when the local copy already exists):
<pre code="javaCode">
     <span class="javaCommentSingle">//sets the target revision of the copy being checked out.</span>
     editor.targetRevision(revision);

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* ISVNEditor.openRoot is not called;
      * setting root directory properties.
      */</span>
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName, propertyValue);

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* adds "/dirA". copyDirFromPath & copyFromRevision - are irrelevant 
      * in an update editor.
      * If you want to have a compatibility with the native Subversion 
      * command line client in the case of a checkout (not simply an export) 
      * an implementation of this method should create an administrative 
      * area (.svn directory) for the directory being added ("/dirA").
      */</span> 
     editor.addDir(<span class="javaString">"/dirA"</span>, copyDirFromPath, CopyFromRevision);

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* setting the directory properties - they may be stored in the 
      * previously created .svn directory (SVN command line client 
      * compatibility).
      * Also all further calls like editor.addFile(..)/editor.addDir(..)
      * are relative to the added directory.
      */</span>
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName1, propertyValue1);
     editor.changeDirProperty(propertyName2, propertyValue2);

     .....................................

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* adds file "file1.txt". copyFileFromPath & copyFromRevision - are 
      * irrelevant in an update editor.

     <span class="javaCommentMulti">/* setting properties of "file1.txt". May be saved in .svn
